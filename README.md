## Description

This is a refactored application. This was originally a Node.js project but has been refactored into Python Flask application. You can see your friends, comment on them, and upvote them. Users can also edit, delete, and create their own posts. Storing all this information is thanks to SQLAlchemy, and Flask for VM testing.
